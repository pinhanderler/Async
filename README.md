# Async
"Everything in this repository was done as a "–ú–æ–¥–µ–ª—é–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–±–µ–∑–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–Ω—è (20402040)" course assigment.
 The aim is to develop a project using 'Async'."


An async function is a function declared with the async keyword. Async functions are instances of the AsyncFunction constructor, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
Async functions may also be defined as expressions.


 Parameters
 "name" The function‚Äôs name.
 "param" The name of an argument to be passed to the function 
 "statements" The statements comprising the body of the function.  The await mechanism may be used.
 "Return value" A Promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception thrown from, or uncaught within, the async function.

The "await" keyword is only valid inside async functions. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a "SyntaxError".
The purpose of "async/await" is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of "async/await" is similar to combining generators and promises.
